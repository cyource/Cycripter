###Introduction

A mini mobile Scripting tool for Android (with extra system-integrated features for CyanogenMod 12.1+), Cycripter runs some simple commands to make things easier for you. Enter and go! It carries out the function coded, giving a command-line-ish experience combined with a mini-scripter.

###CyanogenMod
Exclusveley for CyanogenMod 12.1+, using the Cyanogen Platform SDK, I added a custom quick tile with expanded menu (layout @ remote_view.xml) within Quick Menu for Cycripter, integrating it in some capacity to the framework.

###Current Development Focus
â€¢ Code Efficency/Simplification
