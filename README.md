###Introduction

A mini-mobile Scripting tool for Android, Cycripter runs some simple commands to make things easier for you. Enter and go! It carries out the function coded, giving a command-line-ish experience combined with a mini-scripter. Weather it's maths operations, tetx printing to the console or texting someone right from the app - it all comes in Cycripter.

###CyanogenMod
Exclusveley for CyanogenMod 12.1+, using the Cyanogen Platform SDK, I added a custom quick tile with expanded menu within Quick Menu for Cycripter, integrating it in some capacity to the framework. Code for this called at the onCreate method at MainActivity.java, but it checks if the device runs CyanogenMod and the right version of the Custom ROM for the Quick Tile feature to work, so it won't affect the app experience for users/developers not running CyanogenMod 12.1+.

###Current Development Focus
â€¢ Code Efficency/Simplification
