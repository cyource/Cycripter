###Introduction to Cycripter
A mini-mobile Scripting tool for Android, Cycripter runs some simple commands to make things easier for you. Enter and go! It carries out the function coded, giving a command-line-ish experience combined with a mini-scripter.

###Core for Android
Cycripter is powered by a built-in, little programming language called Core, developed by me. Here is some example Core code to get you started:
<br>
<br>• android.print(&quot;TEXT&quot;)
<br>• android.print(NO. x/+-& NO.)
<br>• android.action([callNumb]-NO.)
<br>• android.action([textMssg]-&quot;MSSG&quot;-NO.)
<br>• android.action([sendMail]-&quot;TITLE&quot;-&quot;MAIL&quot;-&quot;TO&quot;)
<br>
<br>This code can be found in the App's RemoteExpandedStyle of the Quick Settings Menu for CyanogenMod
